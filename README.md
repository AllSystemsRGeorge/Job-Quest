## Overview
​
### The challenge
​
This is a collaborative project to create a real world full stack application by showcasing skills we have acquired. This project aims to provide people with practical application. 
​
### User Story

AS AN unemployed bootcamp student
I WANT to be able to log, view and track all the jobs that I am interested and have applied 
SO THAT I can organize my job applications and get a job
```

### Acceptance Criteria
​
```
GIVEN a user friendly web application
WHEN I input my username and password
THEN I sign up and log in to my account
WHEN I input information about a job
THEN I save the information in a data base for future reference
WHEN I choose to view the job's information
THEN I am presented with all the information
WHEN I log out of the session
THEN I end my session and redirected to the login page
```
​
### Screenshot
​
![](./screenshot.jpg)
​
Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.
​
Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.
​
Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.
​
**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
