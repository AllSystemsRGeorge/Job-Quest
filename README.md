## Overview
​
### The challenge
​
This is a collaborative project to create a real world full stack application by showcasing skills we have acquired. This project aims to provide people with practical application. 
​
### User Story

I WANT to be able to log, view and track all the jobs that I am interested and have applied 
SO THAT I can organize my job applications and get a job
```

### Acceptance Criteria
​
```
GIVEN a user friendly web application
WHEN I input my username and password
THEN I sign up and log in to my account
WHEN I input information about a job

### What we learned
​
This project was a great opportunity to showcase the skills we have learned in the bootcamp. In addition to setting a stronger coding foundation, we learned the intricacies of creating an application with the front end and back end. With the back end, we were able to set up a server and create a database. We used handlebars for the front end of our application. 

In addition to the skills to code the application, we learned how to work in a team. Each of our team members had different backgrounds, so learning how to showcase each of our strengths was proven to be efficacious. We also learned that communication was key to the development of our app. 

### Continued development
​
Although we are proud of what we have made, there are still more room for improvement. We would like to save and display more information about the jobs that we are interested or have applied to. We included a search input so that we can search specific job given several jobs we have applied to. We would also like to further improve the user authentication.
